# COEFIT
**Cost-Effective IT**

COEFIT is a framework for designing and deploying IT environments that are:

- **Affordable** – built primarily on open-source and freely available technologies, reducing licensing costs.  
- **Reliable** – based on proven solutions with strong community or enterprise support.  
- **Scalable** – adaptable to small, medium, or large environments without major architectural changes.  
- **Efficient** – minimizing complexity and resource consumption while maintaining functionality.  
- **Automatable** – many components can be deployed and managed using [ezy-install](https://github.com/source-saraiva/ezy-install), reducing time-to-production.  

The goal of COEFIT is to give system administrators, IT managers, and small-to-medium businesses a clear roadmap for building a modern IT infrastructure without overspending.
